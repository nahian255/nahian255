I am Mutawchid Nahian. I am a junior MERN stack web developer. I studied for a diploma in engineering in electronic technology. I have developed a strong passion for web development and have been actively pursuing it. I learned a lot about programming and building websites. I also took online courses to improve my skills. During my studies, I worked on different web projects, both on my own and with a team. I got really good at using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the building blocks of websites. I also know how to use JavaScript frameworks like React and CSS frameworks Bootstrap and Tailwind. I am comfortable to use to express.js, node.js, and Mongodb.
